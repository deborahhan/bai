    <h2>Charlie Brown</h2>
    <img src="charlie.png" />
    <p style ='border-width:3px; border-style:dotted; border-color: #000000; padding: 1em;'> Charlie Brown is a lovable but often hapless character who is best known 
      for his round head, distinctive zigzag shirt, and his struggles with various 
      aspects of life, including school, relationships, and self-confidence. 
      Charlie Brown is the manager of the Peanuts baseball team, despite his 
      team's consistent lack of success. He is also known for his pet beagle, 
      Snoopy, who is one of the most iconic and beloved characters in the Peanuts 
      universe. </p>
    <h2>Snoopy</h2>
    <img src="snoopy.png" />
    <p style ='border-width:3px; border-style:dotted; border-color: #000000; padding: 1em;'>Snoopy is a beagle known for his vivid imagination and quirky personality. 
      He is one of the most iconic and beloved characters in the Peanuts universe.
      Snoopy is often seen lounging atop his doghouse, typing novels on a typewriter 
      that exists only in his imagination. He has a rich fantasy life where he 
      pretends to be a World War I flying ace battling the Red Baron, a famous 
      fictional pilot. Snoopy is also known for his alter ego, "Joe Cool," and 
      he frequently engages in various other personas and daydreams.
      Despite being a dog, Snoopy exhibits human-like traits and emotions. He has 
      a close relationship with his owner, Charlie Brown, and often provides a 
      source of humor and wisdom in the Peanuts comic strip. Snoopy's distinctive 
      appearance includes his white and black fur, a red doghouse, and a unique 
      nose.</p>
    <h2>Woodstock</h2>

    <p style ='border-width:3px; border-style:dotted; border-color: #000000; padding: 1em;'>Woodstock is a small, yellow bird who is best known as the close and loyal 
      companion of Snoopy. Woodstock is named after the Woodstock Festival, a 
      famous 1969 music festival, reflecting the cultural and social influences of 
      the time. The character is distinctive for being a non-anthropomorphic bird, 
      meaning that he doesn't have human characteristics like the other characters 
      in the Peanuts strip. Despite his small size and lack of traditional human 
      features, Woodstock communicates with Snoopy and other characters through 
      expressive chirps, body language, and sometimes thought bubbles with 
      pictures.</p>
    <h2>Lucy Van Pelt</h2>

      her confident and assertive demeanor. She is often seen dispensing advice 
      from her "psychiatric booth," which she sets up to offer psychiatric help 
      for a nickel. Lucy is also known for her unrequited love for Schroeder, a 
      character who is passionate about playing the piano. One of Lucy's most 
      iconic characteristics is her tendency to pull away the football just as 
      Charlie Brown is about to kick it, causing him to fall on his back. This 
      running gag became a recurring theme in the comic strip and was a source 
      of frustration for Charlie Brown. Despite her bossy and sometimes domineering 
      nature, Lucy is a complex character with moments of vulnerability and 
      insecurity.</p>

      penchant for wearing sandals. She often wears a green t-shirt with black 
      shorts. Peppermint Patty is a good athlete and is frequently shown 
      participating in various sports, particularly baseball and ice hockey. She 
      has a friendly and easygoing demeanor, but she can also be a bit oblivious or 
      absentminded at times. One of the notable aspects of Peppermint Patty's 
      character is her friendship with Marcie, another Peanuts character who serves 
      as her loyal and bookish friend. Despite her casual attitude, Peppermint Patty 
      struggles with academics, and Marcie often helps her with schoolwork.</p>

      his intelligence, philosophical nature, and his security blanket. Linus is the 
      younger brother of Lucy van Pelt, and he often finds himself caught in the 
      middle of Lucy's bossy behavior. Despite his young age, Linus is portrayed 
      as one of the more intellectual and thoughtful characters in the strip. He is 
      often seen sucking his thumb and holding onto his security blanket, which 
      becomes a defining characteristic of his persona. One of Linus's notable 
      traits is his deep wisdom and his tendency to offer insightful, philosophical 
      statements. He is also known for his belief in the "Great Pumpkin," a 
      character similar to Santa Claus, whom he believes rises from the pumpkin 
      patch on Halloween to deliver presents to sincere and believing children.</p>

      "Peanuts" strip on August 23, 1959. She is a kindergarten-aged character, and 
      much of her humor revolves around her interactions with her older brother, 
      Charlie Brown, as well as her experiences at school and with other Peanuts 
      characters. Sally is often portrayed as a sweet and well-meaning character, 
      but she can also be quite naive and has a tendency to misunderstand complex 
      concepts. She is known for her school reports, which often start with the 
      line "The following report is on a book I read," and then proceed to offer 
      unconventional and humorous interpretations of the material.</p>

      his young age, he is a serious and dedicated musician with a deep love for 
      classical music, particularly the works of Ludwig van Beethoven. He is often 
      depicted playing the piano with great skill and concentration, shutting out 
      the world around him. One of the recurring themes in the Peanuts strip 
      involves Schroeder's unrequited love. Lucy van Pelt, another Peanuts 
      character, is infatuated with Schroeder and often tries to win his affection, 
      but Schroeder remains more focused on his music than on romantic relationships.</p>
